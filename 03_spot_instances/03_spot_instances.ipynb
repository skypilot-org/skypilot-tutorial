    "# Saving costs with managed spot jobs 💸\n",
    "As an intercloud broker, SkyPilot also supports spot instances, low-priced VMs that can be preempted at any time by the cloud provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, SkyPilot offers a fully managed experience for running jobs on spot instances **that can automatically recover from preemptions**. This feature **saves significant cost (e.g., up to 70% for GPU VMs)** by making preemptible spot instances practical for long-running jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To maximize availability, SkyPilot automatically finds available spot resources across regions and clouds. Here is an example of BERT training job running in different regions across AWS and GCP, switching over to a different region whenever preempted.\n",

    "# Running managed spot jobs with `sky spot launch`\n",
    "Any SkyPilot task can be launched on spot instances by simply using `sky spot launch task.yaml` instead of `sky launch task.yaml`. The `sky spot` CLI offers the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`sky spot launch <task.yaml>`** - Launches a managed spot job.\n",
    "2. **`sky spot status`** - Shows the status of managed spot jobs.\n",
    "3. **`sky spot logs <job_id>`** - Fetches the logs of a spot job.\n",
    "4. **`sky spot cancel <job_id>`** - Cancels a spot job.\n",
    "\n",
    "To manage the lifecycle of spot jobs, SkyPilot uses a controller that handles job launching and failure recovery. On running `sky spot launch`, SkyPilot first launches a controller (if it does not exist) and then runs the job. The controller is shared across all spot jobs launched by you."
